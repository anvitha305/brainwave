# Brainwave

This project is an idea I had for designing a sonic esolang (i.e., one based on the properties of a sound file) based on the suggestion in the ideas list in the [Esolangs wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/List_of_ideas). brainwav.c will have porter functions from Brainfuck to the .wav file whose properties we use to store the programming. The project will also evidently have an interpreter for the wav file.
